    "Multithreading in Python allows you to run multiple threads (smaller units of a process) concurrently, providing a way to execute multiple tasks concurrently. Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) limits the execution of multiple threads in a single process, so Python threads are more suitable for I/O-bound tasks rather than CPU-bound tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a basic example using the `threading` module:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import threading\n",
    "import time\n",
    "\n",
    "def print_numbers():\n",
    "    for i in range(5):\n",
    "        time.sleep(1)\n",
    "        print(f\"Thread 1: {i}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "def print_letters():\n",
    "    for letter in 'ABCDE':\n",
    "        time.sleep(1)\n",
    "        print(f\"Thread 2: {letter}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create two threads\n",
    "thread1 = threading.Thread(target=print_numbers)\n",
    "thread2 = threading.Thread(target=print_letters)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Start the threads\n",
    "thread1.start()\n",
    "thread2.start()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Wait for both threads to finish\n",
    "thread1.join()\n",
    "thread2.join()\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Both threads have finished.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, two threads (`thread1` and `thread2`) are created, and each is assigned a target function (`print_numbers` and `print_letters`). The `start()` method initiates the execution of the threads, and the `join()` method ensures that the main program waits for both threads to finish before continuing.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) can impact the performance of multithreading in CPU-bound tasks. For CPU-bound tasks, consider using the `concurrent.futures` module, which provides a high-level interface for creating and managing threads and processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple example using the `concurrent.futures` module:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import concurrent.futures\n",
    "import time\n",
    "\n",
    "def print_numbers():\n",
    "    for i in range(5):\n",
    "        time.sleep(1)\n",
    "        print(f\"Thread 1: {i}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "def print_letters():\n",
    "    for letter in 'ABCDE':\n",
    "        time.sleep(1)\n",
    "        print(f\"Thread 2: {letter}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a ThreadPoolExecutor\n",
    "with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:\n",
    "    # Submit the tasks to the executor\n",
    "    future1 = executor.submit(print_numbers)\n",
    "    future2 = executor.submit(print_letters)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Wait for both tasks to complete\n",
    "    concurrent.futures.wait([future1, future2])\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Both threads have finished.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, a `ThreadPoolExecutor` is used to submit tasks (`print_numbers` and `print_letters`) to a thread pool. The `concurrent.futures.wait()` function is used to wait for both tasks to complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember to consider the nature of your tasks (CPU-bound or I/O-bound) when deciding whether to use multithreading or multiprocessing in Python."
