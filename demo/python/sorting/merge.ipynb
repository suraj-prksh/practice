    "Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm for sorting an array. The basic idea behind Merge Sort is to divide the array into two halves, recursively sort each half, and then merge the sorted halves to produce a single sorted array.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a step-by-step explanation of the Merge Sort algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Divide:**\n",
    "   - If the array has zero or one element, it is already sorted.\n",
    "   - Otherwise, divide the array into two halves.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Conquer (Recursively Sort):**\n",
    "   - Recursively sort each half of the array.\n",
    "   - This step involves applying the Merge Sort algorithm to each half of the array until the base case (zero or one element) is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Merge:**\n",
    "   - Merge the two sorted halves into a single sorted array.\n",
    "   - The merging process involves comparing elements from the two halves and arranging them in the correct order.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key operation in Merge Sort is the merging step, which efficiently combines two sorted arrays into a single sorted array. This is achieved by comparing the elements of the two arrays and placing them in the correct order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example with the array `[64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Divide:**\n",
    "  - The array is divided into two halves: `[64, 34, 25]` and `[12, 22, 11, 90]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Recursively Sort:**\n",
    "  - Each half is recursively sorted using the same Merge Sort algorithm.\n",
    "  - `[64, 34, 25]` is divided into `[64]`, `[34]`, and `[25]`.\n",
    "  - `[12, 22, 11, 90]` is divided into `[12]`, `[22]`, `[11]`, and `[90]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Merge:**\n",
    "  - The sorted halves are merged. For example, the two halves `[34]` and `[25]` are merged into `[25, 34]`.\n",
    "  - The process continues until the entire array is sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "The time complexity of Merge Sort is O(n log n), making it efficient for large datasets. It is a stable sorting algorithm, meaning that it preserves the relative order of equal elements in the sorted output. Additionally, Merge Sort is suitable for linked lists and external sorting scenarios."
